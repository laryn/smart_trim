Smart Trim
======================

Smart Trim implements a new field formatter for textfields (text, text_long, and
text_with_summary, if you want to get technical) that improved upon the "Summary
or Trimmed" formatter built into Drupal 7 and ported to Backdrop CMS.

After installing and enabling Smart Trim, you should see a "Smart trimmed"
option in the format dropdown for your text fields. With smart trim, you have
control over:

  1. The trim length
  2. Whether the trim length is measured in characters or words
  3. Appending an optional suffix at the trim point
  4. Displaying an optional "More" link immediately after the trimmed text.
  5. Stripping out HTML tags from the field

The "More" link functionality may not make sense in many contexts, and may be
redundant in situations where "Read More" is included in set of links included
with the node.

Note that HTML markup not seen by end-users will still be counted when
calculating trim length. This may be addressed in future releases.
